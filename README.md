<h1>Virtual Doppelganger</h1>
A small game that I wanna make in the future. The concept is simple - a game where you fight with your own skills. <br>
The enitre game takes place at your desktop, it will be kinda vampire-survivors style game. <br>
The more health you lose, the more occupied your desktop will be and more RAM will be used, you lose when your game crashes, or your desktop fills out, got that?<br>
Only proof of concept for now though, as didn't have time for it
